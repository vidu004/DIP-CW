Skin Lesion Analysis Tool
This repository contains a Python-based Skin Lesion Analysis Tool, designed to detect and analyze skin lesions in images. The tool utilizes computer vision techniques to identify edges and lesions in skin images, helping medical professionals or researchers analyze potential skin conditions.

Features
Edge Detection: The tool uses edge detection algorithms (Canny, Sobel, etc.) to identify the boundaries of skin lesions in images.
Lesion Detection: The tool extracts and identifies potential skin lesions based on grayscale thresholds and morphological operations.
Image Preprocessing: The input image undergoes various preprocessing steps (like histogram equalization and contrast enhancement) to improve the accuracy of detection.
Visualization: The tool generates a combined mask that highlights detected lesions and edges for better analysis.
Requirements
To run this tool, youâ€™ll need the following Python packages:

opencv-python for image processing tasks
numpy for array manipulation
matplotlib for visualizing images (optional)
